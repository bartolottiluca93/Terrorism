    "overview": "Boko Haram (JAS) is a Nigerian-born, Salafi-jihadist armed group founded by Mohammed Yusuf in 2002 in Maiduguri, Borno State. The group’s ideology is anti-Western, anti-establishment, and seeks to create a Salafi Islamic state governed by sharia—opposing ‘Westernization’ and secular education. Under Abubakar Shekau (leader 2009–2021), the group grew more radical and indiscriminately violent, becoming notorious globally for suicide bombings, mass abductions such as the 2014 Chibok girls kidnapping, and the use of women and children as suicide bombers. After Shekau’s death in 2021 and the loss of territory/fighters to ISIS-West Africa (ISWAP), Boko Haram fragmented but continues frequent attacks in Nigeria and neighboring countries. In 2022, Bakura Doro became amir and has since shifted tactics towards criminality (cattle rustling, kidnapping, illegal taxation), cross-border raids, and rural terror. Membership is estimated at 1,500 fighters, mainly operating in small cells around Lake Chad, the Sambisa Forest, northern Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. The group is unaffiliated with ISIS or al-Qaeda as of 2025, surviving largely as an organized violent criminal enterprise.",
