    "overview": "Islamic State–Mozambique (ISIS-M), also known as Ansar al-Sunna (ASWJ) and locally as Al-Shabaab, is a Mozambican ISIS affiliate based in Cabo Delgado province. Originally emerging as a non-violent religious organization in 2015, ISIS-M launched its first attack in October 2017, escalating into one of Africa's deadliest insurgencies. At its peak in 2020-2021, the group controlled territory including the strategic port town of Mocímboa da Praia and executed the devastating March 2021 Palma attack (100+ deaths). Following military intervention by Rwanda and regional forces (2021-2023), ISIS-M was degraded to 300-500 fighters and dispersed to desert cell-based operations. However, in 2024-2025, ISIS-M has demonstrated remarkable resurgence, expanding southward into previously unaffected districts, adapting governance approaches, incorporating 100+ child fighters, and attracting foreign recruits. The group is notorious for systematic mass beheadings (often of children), sexual slavery of girls as young as seven, and targeting of critical TotalEnergies LNG infrastructure. With 700,000+ displaced and 6,000+ killed, ISIS-M poses a critical transnational threat to Mozambique, the region, and global energy security.",

    "origin_context": "ISIS-M emerged from youth-focused religious revival in Mocímboa da Praia (2015), founded by young men, some educated in Islamic schools in Somalia and with links to Salafi groups in Tanzania/Kenya. Initially non-violent, the movement emerged in response to perceived government marginalization of Muslims and Sufi Islamic leadership's perceived passivity. The group gradually radicalized, transitioned to violent insurgency, and pledged allegiance to ISIS by 2018 (formally recognized August 2019 as ISCAP, then designated separate Wilayat Mozambique May 2022).",
