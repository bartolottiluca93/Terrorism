    "overview": "Islamic State–Libya (ISIS-L) is a North African ISIS affiliate that emerged from Libyan foreign fighters returning from Syria (Battar Brigade) who pledged allegiance to IS in October 2014. At its peak in 2015-2016, ISIS-L controlled major cities including Sirte (August 2015–October 2016) with an estimated 5,000-8,000 fighters. Following sustained military operations and US airstrikes, the group was expelled from major urban centers by late 2016. As of 2025, ISIS-L operates as a degraded but persistent insurgency with 100-500 fighters, primarily based in ungoverned desert areas of central and southern Libya (Fezzan region), exploiting weak state capacity, porous borders, and integration with transnational smuggling networks. In September 2025, ISIS-L issued its first explicit call in three years for renewed jihad in Libya via its Al-Naba newsletter, signaling organizational reconstitution and ambitions for regional comeback. The group maintains links to Sahel jihadists, Sudanese networks, and represents a transnational terrorism threat despite diminished territorial control.",

    "origin_context": "ISIS-L emerged from Libyan foreign fighters who initially formed the Battar Brigade in Syria around 2012 to fight against Assad's regime. These fighters pledged allegiance to ISIS and fought for the caliphate in Syria/Iraq from 2012-2014. In April 2014, approximately 300 Battar Brigade veterans returned to Libya, primarily to Derna, where they reorganized as the Islamic Youth Shura Council (IYSC) in September 2014. The IYSC recruited from local militant networks including Ansar al-Sharia members and declared war on rival groups. Following an IS delegation visit in September 2014, IYSC-aligned factions formally pledged allegiance to IS on October 5, 2014, resulting in the creation of three ISIS-L branches: Cyrenaica (Barqa), Fezzan, and Tripolitania provinces.",
