    "one_line": "Iran's most powerful military branch with 150,000-190,000 personnel, designated FTO in 2019, operates global proxy network through IRGC-QF (5,000-15,000 personnel), generates billions through oil smuggling ($9B+ in 2024), conducts assassination plots against US officials including Donald Trump/John Bolton, provides $1B+ annually to Hezbollah, and controls Axis of Resistance spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza.",
    "overview": "The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is Iran's most powerful military and political organization, established May 5, 1979 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to protect the Islamic Revolution and serve as counterweight to Iran's regular army (Artesh). Reporting directly to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, the IRGC comprises 150,000-190,000 active personnel organized into Ground Forces (150,000), Navy (20,000+), Aerospace Force, Basij militia (600,000 volunteers mobilizable), and the elite IRGC-Qods Force (5,000-15,000). The IRGC-QF, established 1989-1990, conducts extraterritorial asymmetric warfare, terrorism, and proxy coordination globally. Under legendary commander Qassim Soleimani (1997-2020, killed by US drone strike January 3, 2020), the IRGC-QF built the 'Axis of Resistance'—network of Shia militias, Palestinian groups, and regional proxies including Lebanese Hezbollah ($700M-$1B+ annually), Iraqi PMF/Kata'ib Hezbollah, Syrian militias, Yemeni Houthis, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Current IRGC-QF commander Esmail Qaani (2020-present) lacks Soleimani's charisma but maintains operational continuity. The IRGC generates revenue through massive oil smuggling operations ($9B+ identified in 2024 through shadow banking, front companies in UAE/Singapore/Hong Kong), weapons trafficking, and economic control of 40%+ of Iranian economy. IRGC-QF Unit 840 specializes in overseas assassination operations, documented plots 2020-2025 targeting US officials (Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, Robert O'Brien), Iranian dissidents, and Jewish/Israeli targets. As of November 2025, IRGC provides weaponry (drones, missiles, rockets) enabling Houthi Red Sea attacks disrupting global shipping, Hezbollah-Israel conflict (Operation Northern Arrows 2024-2025), and Iraqi militia operations against US forces.",

The IRGC-Qods Force formed 1989-1990 post-Iran-Iraq War through merger of four organizations: Islamic Liberation Movements Unit, Irregular Warfare Headquarters, Lebanon Guard, and Ramezan Headquarters, creating monopoly over extraterritorial operations.",
