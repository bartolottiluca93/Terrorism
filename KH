    "one_line": "Iran's most powerful Iraqi proxy with 7,000-10,000 fighters, founded 2007, conducted 150+ attacks on US forces since October 2023, controls PMF key departments (chief of staff, security, intelligence), evacuated Syria December 2024 after Assad collapse, receives extensive IRGC-QF training/weapons/funding.",
    "overview": "Kata'ib Hizballah (KH, 'Hezbollah Brigades') is the most powerful and operationally sophisticated Iranian-backed Shia militia in Iraq, established March 2003-2007 by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis (Jamal Jafaar al-Ibrahim), an Iraqi-Iranian dual national and senior IRGC-Qods Force adviser. With 7,000-10,000 fighters, KH operates as the dominant force within Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF, 238,000 total members as of 2024), controlling critical PMF departments including chief of staff, security, intelligence, missiles, and anti-armor. Founded to expel US forces from Iraq and establish an Iran-aligned government, KH killed 600+ US soldiers (2007-2011) using sophisticated explosively formed projectiles (EFPs), improvised rocket-assisted munitions (IRAMs), and sniper operations, earning designation as Foreign Terrorist Organization July 2, 2009. After Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was killed alongside IRGC-QF Commander Qassim Soleimani in a January 3, 2020 US drone strike at Baghdad International Airport, Ahmad al-Hamidawi (designated SDGT February 26, 2020) assumed leadership. Since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, KH led the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) coalition in conducting 180+ attacks on US forces in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan, including the January 28, 2024 Tower 22 drone strike that killed 3 US servicemembers. The group temporarily suspended operations January 30, 2024 to avoid 'embarrassing' the Iraqi government but resumed attacks June 2025 following Israeli Operation Rising Lion strikes on Iran. KH evacuated all personnel from Syria in December 2024 after the Assad regime collapsed, losing a critical strategic corridor for Iranian weapons transfers to Hezbollah. As of November 2025, KH remains the most secretive and dangerous Iran-backed militia, receiving extensive training, weapons (drones, missiles, EFPs, MANPADS), intelligence, and funding from IRGC-QF, with direct operational coordination from Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei.",

    "origin_context": "KH emerged from IRGC-QF's consolidation of Iraqi Shia 'special groups' that split from Muqtada al-Sadr's Jaish al-Mahdi (JAM) militia during 2004-2007 uprisings against US occupation. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi expatriate living in Iran since the 1980s (wanted by Kuwait for 1983 US/French embassy bombings and 1985 emir assassination attempt), was appointed by IRGC-QF to unify fractious pro-Iranian militias into a disciplined, hierarchical organization modeled on Lebanese Hezbollah. IRGC-QF and Lebanese Hezbollah (Unit 3800) provided initial training at Kermanshah camps in Iran, building a cadre of ~400 elite fighters focused on operational security and advanced tactics. KH set a new standard for Iraqi militias: strict compartmentalization, sophisticated weaponry (EFPs, IRAMs), professional media operations, and absolute loyalty to Iran's Supreme Leader over Iraqi government.",

With 7,000-10,000 fighters controlling key PMF departments (chief of staff, security, intelligence, missiles), KH represents the primary threat to US forces in Iraq and a critical pillar of Iran's Axis of Resistance. The group conducted 180+ attacks on US forces Oct 2023-Aug 2024, including the January 28, 2024 Tower 22 drone strike (3 US soldiers killed, 47 injured). Despite January 2024 'suspension' announcement, attacks resumed June 2025 following Israeli strikes on Iran. December 2024 evacuation from Syria after Assad regime collapse represents major strategic setback, severing Iran's land bridge to Hezbollah and disrupting weapons transfers. However, KH maintains robust capabilities, extensive IRGC-QF support, and Iraqi government protection through PMF status.
