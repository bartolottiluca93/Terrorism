    "one_line": "Africa's deadliest ISIS affiliate, controlling parts of North Kivu and Ituri provinces in eastern DRC with 1,000-1,500 fighters, responsible for 4,000+ civilian deaths since 2014.",
    "overview": "Islamic State–Central Africa (ISIS-CA), also known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), is one of Africa's most lethal terrorist groups and the deadliest ISIS affiliate on the continent. Originally founded in Uganda in 1995 as a secular insurgency, the ADF gradually radicalized into a Salafi-jihadist organization and relocated to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002. The group pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2019 and was formally recognized as ISIS's Central Africa Province. ISIS-CA operates primarily in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where it maintains semi-autonomous territorial control, conducts sophisticated coordinated attacks against civilians and military targets, and generates revenue through extortion and kidnapping. Despite joint military operations (Operation Shujaa) by Uganda and DRC since November 2021, the group remains resilient, has expanded recruitment networks across East Africa, and demonstrated escalating operational capacity through 2025.",

Both were initially sponsored by Mobutu Sese Seko's Zaire and Omar al-Bashir's Sudan to destabilize Yoweri Museveni's Uganda. Following Mobutu's fall in 1997, the ADF retreated to Rwenzori Mountains and gradually embraced Islamic ideology.",
