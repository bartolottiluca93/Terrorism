    "overview": "Islamic State–Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) is the Afghanistan-based affiliate of the Islamic State, formed in 2015 through consolidation of Pakistani Taliban (TTP), Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), and other Central Asian jihadist factions. Under leadership of Sanaullah Ghafari (appointed 2020), ISIS-K has transformed into the IS's most operationally capable affiliate for external operations, conducting mass-casualty attacks in Russia (Crocus City Hall, 144+ killed), Iran (Kerman bombing, 80+ killed), Pakistan, Afghanistan, and targeting Europe and the United States. With estimated 2,000-6,000 fighters operating from remote bases in Afghanistan and Pakistan, ISIS-K receives direct strategic guidance and financial support from IS central, receives up to $25,000 monthly in cryptocurrency, and maintains expansionist recruitment networks across Central Asia, with particular appeal to Tajik and Uzbek minorities alienated by regional governance. As of 2025, ISIS-K represents the predominant transnational terrorist threat to Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the West, with demonstrated capability and intent for external attacks.",

Beginning 2012, Pakistani Taliban (TTP) leader Hafiz Saeed Khan dispatched fighters to Syria to support IS insurgency. By 2014, thousands of Afghan and Pakistani fighters had joined IS in Syria and Iraq through organized recruitment networks. IS central leadership, seeking to expand the caliphate eastward and appreciate these foreign fighters' contributions, appointed Khan to lead a new 'Khorasan Province' in late 2014, formally announced January 2015. The name 'Khorasan' references the historical Islamic region encompassing modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and parts of Iran.",
