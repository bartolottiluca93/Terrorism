    "overview": "Al-Shabaab is a Sunni Islamist militant group and Al-Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia that emerged as the military wing of the Islamic Courts Union in 2006. Following Ethiopian-backed military intervention in 2007, the group evolved into a sophisticated insurgency controlling large portions of central and southern Somalia. As of 2025, Al-Shabaab represents Al-Qaeda's wealthiest and operationally most capable affiliate, generating $150+ million annually through taxation, illicit trade, and external support. The group maintains sophisticated governance structures, enforces Islamic law, and has demonstrated increasing military capability through drone reconnaissance and coordinated multi-site operations. In 2025, Al-Shabaab launched a major offensive recovering strategic territories and encircling Mogadishu, threatening years of government gains.",
