    "overview": "Islamic Jihad Union (IJU, formerly Islamic Jihad Group/IJG) is an Al-Qaeda-affiliated Central Asian terrorist organization founded March 2002 as splinter group from Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). Renamed to IJU in May 2005, the group transitioned from regional Uzbekistan-focused insurgency (2002-2005) to internationalized jihadist movement coordinating with Al-Qaeda and Taliban networks. Initially headquartered in North Waziristan (Mir Ali, Pakistan), IJU operates across Afghanistan-Pakistan tribal areas with pockets in Central Asia and Caucasus. Membership estimated 100-200 fighters (significantly smaller than parent IMU). IJU achieved international notoriety through: (1) 2007 Sauerland terror cell plot to attack Frankfurt Airport, US Ramstein Air Base, and civilian targets in Germany using 700kg hydrogen peroxide explosives; (2) recruitment of Western European converts (Germans, Turks, Scandinavians); (3) significant presence of Arabic-speaking foreign fighters from Middle East. Under leadership of founders Najmiddin Jalolov (Abu Yahya Muhammad Fatih) and Suhayl Buranov (Abu Huzaifa), IJU claims ideological focus on internationalizing 'Holy War' beyond Uzbekistan while maintaining Al-Qaeda coordination. Suffered significant degradation 2008-2009 through Pakistani and international military operations (Operation Falcon), US drone strikes killing multiple leadership figures. As of 2025, IJU operates as fragmented Al-Qaeda affiliate with reduced capabilities, conducting sporadic operations in Afghanistan (Badakhshan, Kunduz provinces) alongside Taliban forces, with minimal recent external operations. Organization maintains media arm (Badr al-Tawhid, Jundullah Studio) producing multilingual propaganda in Arabic, Uzbek, German, Russian, and Turkish.",

IMU leadership, particularly Tahir Yuldashev following death of military commander Juma Namangani (killed 2001 by US airstrikes in Afghanistan), pursued global jihad model aligned with Al-Qaeda. However, dissident faction led by Jalolov and Buranov rejected IMU's narrow regional focus, advocating internationalization of Central Asian jihad. This ideological dispute resulted in IJU formation as separate organization initially called Islamic Jihad Group (IJG), settling in North Waziristan Pakistan near Taliban strongholds.",
