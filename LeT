    "one_line": "Pakistan's premier anti-India jihadist group founded 1990, several thousand fighters, responsible for 2008 Mumbai attacks (166 killed), 2006 train bombings (200+ killed), 2025 Pahalgam massacre (26 killed), operating through proxy The Resistance Front (TRF), financed by Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation, escalating infiltration November 2025.",
    "overview": "Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT, 'Army of the Righteous') is Pakistan's most lethal and operationally sophisticated anti-India jihadist organization, founded January 1990 by Hafiz Muhammad Saeed as the military wing of Markaz-ud-Dawa-wal-Irshad (MDI), an Ahl-e-Hadith (Salafi) Islamic missionary organization. With an estimated several thousand fighters, LeT's primary objective is establishing Pakistani sovereignty over Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, with broader aims of extending Islamic governance across India. LeT is directly supported by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), establishing it as a state-sponsored terrorist proxy. The group achieved international notoriety through the July 11, 2006 Mumbai train bombings (200+ killed, 700+ wounded) and the devastating November 26-29, 2008 Mumbai attacks (166 killed including 6 Americans, 300+ wounded), orchestrated by deputy commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and external operations chief Sajid Mir. Despite being banned by Pakistan (January 2002), the US (December 2001), and the UN (May 2005), LeT operates openly in Pakistan through front organizations Jamaat-ud-Dawa (charitable organization with schools/hospitals) and Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation, funded by donors in Pakistan ($million+ annually), Saudi Arabia, and Middle Eastern countries. Following Indian counter-terrorism operations (Operation Sindoor, May 2025), LeT escalated operations through its proxy The Resistance Front (TRF), conducting the April 22, 2025 Pahalgam attack (26 tourists killed—deadliest Kashmir civilian massacre since 2019), the October 20, 2024 Ganderbal construction site shooting (7 killed), and subsequent coordinated strikes. As of November 2025, fresh intelligence reveals LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammad are conducting largest coordinated infiltration surge since 2023, with multiple units crossing Line of Control (LoC), drone reconnaissance operations, and explicit instructions from ISI to conduct 'retaliatory attacks.' LeT remains the most dangerous Pakistan-based terrorist organization to Indian security and civilian populations.",

    "origin_context": "LeT emerged from the geopolitics of the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) and the subsequent struggle for Kashmir (1989-ongoing). Hafiz Saeed, an engineering professor and religious activist in the Ahl-e-Hadith (Salafi) school, founded Markaz-ud-Dawa-wal-Irshad (MDI) in 1985-1986 as a religious missionary organization with initial support from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan's ISI. As Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistani military strategists (ISI, General Zia's successors) conceived of LeT as a proxy instrument to prosecute Pakistan's claim to Kashmir through 'plausible deniability.' In 1990, Hafiz Saeed formally established LeT as MDI's military wing, initially with ~400 fighters trained in Pakistani Punjab and Afghan Kunar province. Abdullah Azzam (al-Qaeda's ideologue, later killed 1989) provided ideological guidance. Crucially, LeT received direct ISI coordination, training facilities, weapons, and cross-border logistical support from the outset—establishing it as more of a state military proxy than a purely non-state actor.",

November 2025 intelligence reveals largest coordinated infiltration surge since 2023 with 50+ militants crossing LoC, drone reconnaissance operations, and explicit ISI orders to conduct 'retaliatory attacks' for May 2025 Operation Sindoor losses. The group's operational sophistication (2008 Mumbai coordinated multi-site assault, 2025 Pahalgam precision operation), ISI support, access to thousands of trained fighters, professional military-grade facilities (Markaz Taiba), and financial resources ($30M+ annually) establish it as the most dangerous anti-India terrorist organization.
