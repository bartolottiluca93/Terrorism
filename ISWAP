ISWAP controls vast swaths of Lake Chad Basin across Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon, employing sophisticated governance structures, selective taxation, and drone warfare. With estimated annual revenues exceeding $190 million derived primarily from extortion and taxation, ISWAP operates as both terrorist insurgency and quasi-state entity. The group defeated rival Boko Haram faction in 2021, consolidates territorial control, and represents IS's most capable and resilient global franchise.",
