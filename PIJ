    "one_line": "Palestinian Sunni jihadist group founded 1981, ~4,000 fighters, al-Quds Brigades military wing, Iran-funded (primary financier), second-largest Gaza armed group after Hamas, participated October 7, 2023 attack on Israel (~1,200 killed), conducted 1,100+ rockets August 2022 and 4,000+ rockets May 2021, expanding West Bank operations January 2025.",
    "overview": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ, Harakat al-Jihad al-Islami fi Filistin) is a Palestinian Sunni Islamist militant organization founded January 1981 in Gaza by Dr. Fathi abd al-Aziz Shikaki and Sheikh Abd al-Aziz Awda, Palestinian members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood who rejected the Brotherhood's perceived moderation and insufficient commitment to Palestinian liberation. Despite Sunni origins, PIJ drew ideological inspiration from Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and developed close ties with Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Lebanese Hezbollah. The group is devoted exclusively to militant activity (unlike Hamas/Hezbollah's political/social structures) with its military wing al-Quds Brigades responsible for dozens of suicide bombings against Israeli targets (1987-2006 era) and contemporary rocket/mortar operations. PIJ claimed ~30 suicide bombings between 1987-2006 before transitioning to indiscriminate rocket fire. Following founder Fathi Shikaki's 1995 assassination in Malta (attributed to Mossad), Ramadan Shallah became leader; the organization has maintained headquarters in Damascus (Syria) with contingents in Lebanon and Gaza. With approximately 4,000 fighters organized primarily in Gaza and expanding West Bank presence, PIJ participates in coordinated operations through the 'Joint Operations Room' (shared with Hamas and other Palestinian groups). Most notably, PIJ participated in the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that resulted in ~1,200 Israeli deaths, 240+ hostages. Since October 2023, PIJ has conducted 150+ rocket attacks coordinated with Hamas, including 1,100+ rockets (August 2022), 4,000+ rockets (May 2021), and sustained operations January 2025 during Israeli 'Operation Iron Wall' in West Bank. Iran provides the vast majority of PIJ's funding (hundreds of millions annually through IRGC), military training (missile development), and advanced weaponry (Fajr rockets). PIJ's political leadership under Ziyad al-Nakhalah (Secretary General since 2018, designated SDGT 2014) coordinates operations from Damascus, while al-Quds Brigades military commanders direct Gaza and West Bank campaigns. As of November 2025, PIJ represents the second-most dangerous Palestinian armed group after Hamas, with expanding operational capability and deepening Iranian support.",

    "origin_context": "PIJ emerged from split within Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood when Fathi Shikaki and Abd al-Aziz Awda rejected Brotherhood moderation and insufficient commitment to Palestinian cause. In 1979, they established Islamic Jihad-Shikaki Faction as branch of Egyptian Islamic Jihad while operating out of Egypt. Following Egyptian government's 1981 expulsion (aftermath of Anwar Sadat assassination by Egyptian Islamic Jihad), Shikaki and Awda returned to Gaza where they formally established Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The group drew inspiration from 1979 Iranian Revolution's Shia Islamic governance model despite PIJ's Sunni theological identity. Early relationship-building with Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps and Lebanese Hezbollah during the 1980s provided training, funding, and ideological guidance, establishing Iran as PIJ's primary patron.",

Iran provides majority funding ($100M+ annually via IRGC), military training (missile development), and advanced weaponry (Fajr rockets, drones emerging). PIJ is expanding West Bank operations (Jenin Battalion, January 2025 Operation Iron Wall engagement) and increasingly coordinates tactical planning with Hamas. Unlike Hamas/Hezbollah, PIJ focuses exclusively on military operations (no political/social apparatus), making it a pure militant instrument.
