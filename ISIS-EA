    "one_line": "ISIS-East Asia is a small but lethal Southeast Asian ISIS affiliate based in the southern Philippines with fewer than 300 fighters, notable for pioneering female suicide bombings in Asia and threatening regional stability.",
    "overview": "Islamic State–East Asia (ISIS-EA), also known as Daulah Islamiyah (DI), is the Islamic State's regional affiliate operating primarily in the southern Philippines, particularly in Mindanao. With an estimated 200-300 fighters, ISIS-EA emerged from an alliance of the Maute Group and Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) factions that formally pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014-2016. The group achieved international infamy through the May-October 2017 siege of Marawi City, which showcased unprecedented urban combat capability for Southeast Asian jihadists. ISIS-EA is historically unique for deploying female suicide bombers in coordinated attacks beginning around 2018, representing a significant tactical innovation in Asian extremism. Despite heavy military losses, ISIS-EA has demonstrated operational resilience through reorganization under successive leaders, continuing attacks through 2024-2025. With ties to foreign fighters from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Middle Eastern countries, ISIS-EA maintains direct coordination with IS central leadership through propaganda networks and represents a persistent transnational threat to Philippine and regional security.",

    "origin_context": "ISIS-EA emerged from a convergence of two militant movements: (1) The Maute Group, a relatively young insurgent faction founded by the Maute brothers in Lanao del Sur province around 2010, and (2) the Hapilon faction of the Abu Sayyaf Group, a longer-established separatist organization founded in 1991. Following IS territorial success in Iraq and Syria from 2014, both groups independently pledged allegiance to IS by mid-2014. This marked a strategic shift: while historically focused on local Philippine separatism, the groups adopted global jihadist branding to gain international credibility, material support, and operational guidance. The merger created IS-Ranao (Maute faction) and IS-Basilan (Hapilon faction), which gradually coordinated operations through 2015-2017.",
