    "one_line": "Rapidly expanding ISIS affiliate in Sahel with 2,000-3,000 fighters (425 in 2018), controlling Liptako-Gourma region worth billions in gold/uranium, claiming 400+ attacks in Apr-Jul 2025 killing 2,870 people.",
    "overview": "Islamic State–Sahel Province (ISSP), formerly Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), is the most dynamically expanding and militarily capable ISIS affiliate in Africa. Emerging from al-Mourabitoun faction under Western Saharan Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi in May 2015, ISIS-Sahel evolved from anti-Al-Qaeda split into formal ISIS affiliate (recognized October 2016), upgraded to autonomous province March 2022. The group operates across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, controlling portions of the strategically critical Liptako-Gourma tri-border region rich in gold and uranium deposits. Membership surged from 425 fighters (2018) to 2,000-3,000 (2025)—a 4-6x expansion—driven by political instability, Western military withdrawal, and resource competition with Al-Qaeda-affiliated JNIM. Commanded by Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi until French drone strike (August 2021, confirmed September 2021), ISIS-Sahel demonstrates unprecedented operational sophistication: 400+ attacks April-July 2025 killing 2,870 civilians/soldiers, integration of AI and commercial drones, coordinated multi-site operations, and evolving governance structures. The group generates $6 million+ annually through resource extraction (gold/uranium taxation), kidnap-for-ransom, extortion, and IS central support. As of 2025, ISIS-Sahel represents the primary terrorist threat to West African stability and regional energy infrastructure.",

This faction pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on May 15, 2015, representing shift toward salafi jihadism and decentralized caliphate model. The group initially operated independently under name 'Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS)' before formal IS recognition (October 30, 2016).",
