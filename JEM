    "one_line": "Pakistan-based Deobandi jihadist group with ~500 fighters, founded 2000 by Masood Azhar, responsible for 2019 Pulwama attack (40 killed), devastated by Indian Operation Sindoor (May 2025) killing Abdul Rauf Asghar and 26 others, recently established women's wing for recruitment.",
    "overview": "Jaish-e-Mohammad (JEM) is a Pakistan-based Deobandi jihadist militant group founded January 31, 2000 by Masood Azhar (released from Indian custody after 1999 IC-814 hijacking by his brother Abdul Rauf Asghar). The group's stated objective is to liberate Kashmir from Indian rule and establish Pakistani sovereignty over the disputed region. JEM operates primarily from Bahawalpur, Punjab Province, where it maintained a 15-acre training complex (Markaz Usman-o-Ali) housing 600+ cadres before destruction during Indian Operation Sindoor (May 7, 2025). The group maintains approximately 500 active fighters and operates through proxy organizations including Kashmir Tigers (responsible for 2024 Doda/Kathua attacks). Historically aligned with al-Qaeda and the Taliban, JEM received significant support from Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). After the devastating 2019 Pulwama attack (40 CRPF personnel killed; single deadliest in Kashmir since 1989), Pakistan increased pressure on JEM, though the group continued sporadic operations through 2024-2025. Abdul Rauf Asghar (Masood's brother, senior military commander, IC-814 hijacking mastermind) was killed in Indian Operation Sindoor (May 7, 2025) along with 26 JEM members and 10 family members of Masood Azhar. Masood Azhar himself was reportedly critically injured in the strikes. JEM has expanded recruitment efforts by establishing Jamat ul-Muminat (women's wing) in October 2025, led by Sadiya Azhar (Masood's sister), actively recruiting economically disadvantaged women through online courses and facilities in Bahawalpur, Karachi, Muzaffarabad, and Mansehra. The group maintains connections to al-Qaeda, Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and other jihadist organizations.",

After being released from Indian prison in December 1999 as part of the IC-814 hijacking negotiated settlement, cleric Masood Azhar established JEM with support from Pakistan's ISI, reportedly meeting Taliban leader Mullah Omar and al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden during their time in Afghanistan. The group emerged during a period of escalated Kashmir militancy following the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition and intensified Indian security operations in the region.",
