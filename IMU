    "one_line": "Formerly al-Qaeda-aligned Uzbek jihadist group, now fractured between ISKP and Taliban, with diminished regional threat but sporadic influence in Afghanistan/Pakistan.",
    "overview": "The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) was founded in 1998 by Juma Namangani (military leader) and Tahir Yuldashev (political/ideological leader), with a stated goal of overthrowing the government of Uzbekistan and establishing an Islamic state. Originally based in Tajikistan after fleeing Uzbek security crackdowns, the group relocated to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan in the late 1990s, forging close ties with both the Taliban and al-Qaeda. IMU launched a campaign of armed incursions into Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan (1999-2001), bombed sites in Tashkent, and sent fighters to support Taliban/al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. After Namangani’s death in 2001 and Yuldashev’s in 2009 (both killed by US strikes), IMU leadership fractured. In the 2010s, elements moved operations to northwest Pakistan, participated in cross-border attacks, and eventually some pledged allegiance to Islamic State–Khorasan Province (ISKP) circa 2015. Others maintained or reverted to Taliban alignment. By 2025, the IMU has lost organizational coherence, with most fighters integrated into either ISKP or Taliban networks in Afghanistan and a small remnant in Afghanistan’s north and Pakistan’s tribal belt. Its direct threat to Uzbekistan is now marginal, but its legacy persists in Central Asian jihadist networks.",

    "origin_context": "The IMU traces its origins to the Adolat (Justice) movement in Namangan, Uzbekistan’s Fergana Valley. After Uzbek security forces cracked down on Islamist movements, founding members fled to Tajikistan, participating in the Tajik civil war (1992–1997) and aligning with other Islamist combatants. With the end of that war, IMU leaders shifted to Afghanistan and in 1998 formed a formal organization with explicit allegiance to the Taliban; the group’s ideology became more radical and pan-Islamic. The IMU declared jihad on President Islam Karimov and launched attacks on Uzbekistan aiming to topple the secular government.",
