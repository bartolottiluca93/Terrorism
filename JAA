    "one_line": "Sunni-Baloch separatist group, <500 fighters, founded 2002, renamed 2012, leader Salahuddin Farooqui killed November 2024 (joint Pakistan-Iran operation), continues attacks Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan province (6 civilians killed July 2025), operates Pakistan border sanctuaries.",
    "overview": "Jaysh al-Adl (JAA, 'Army of Justice'), formerly known as Jundallah, is a Sunni Deobandi separatist militant organization based in Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan province with operations extending into Pakistan's Balochistan and Afghanistan. Jundallah was founded 2002-2003 by Abdolmalek Rigi to advance Baloch ethnic rights and oppose perceived Shia discrimination. After Rigi's execution (June 19, 2010), the group fragmented; surviving members reconstituted as Jaysh al-Adl (JAA) in 2012 under leadership of Salahuddin Farooqui (Abdolrahim Mullahzadeh). JAA operates primarily in Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan province with estimated <500 active fighters (CIA 2023 assessment), conducting sporadic attacks against Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), border guards, and civilian targets. Unlike ethnic/resource-focused predecessors, JAA combines Baloch nationalist grievances with Salafi-jihadist ideology. The group faced major setback November 5, 2024 when a joint Pakistan-Iran operation killed Salahuddin Farooqui, deputy leader Mullah Omar Darakhshan, and senior commander (12 militants total), severely degrading leadership structure. However, recent attacks (July-August 2025: courthouse bombing killed 6 civilians; police station assault killed 4) demonstrate operational resilience. JAA is believed financed through kidnapping-for-ransom, extortion of smuggling operations, and alleged external support from US and Saudi Arabia (per Iranian claims; unconfirmed). Cross-border sanctuaries in Pakistan's Balochistan remain critical to operations, with JAA using porous Iran-Pakistan border for infiltration, resupply, and retreat. Group maintains loose ties to Pakistani Baloch separatist groups (Balochistan Liberation Army/BLA, Balochistan Liberation Front/BLF) and reportedly produces explosives and suicide vests in clandestine workshops (August 2025 discovery near Iranshahr). As of November 2025, JAA remains a persistent but contained regional threat, lacking capacity for transnational operations or broader insurgency beyond Baluchistan.",

    "origin_context": "Jundallah emerged from historical Baloch grievances against Iranian state policies, economic marginalization of Baloch minority, and perceived Shia-centric governance. Founded by Abdolmalek Rigi (born ~1970s), a Sunni ideologue from Rask district, Jundallah initially focused on Baloch cultural/political rights advocacy before radicalizing into armed insurgency post-2005. The group was influenced by global jihadist movements and Pakistani-based Baloch nationalist groups (ethnic kinship ties). Rigi established training camps initially in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, coordinating with al-Qaeda networks. After 2001 US invasion of Afghanistan, Rigi shifted operations to Pakistan's Balochistan, exploiting porous Iran-Pakistan border for cross-border raids.",

Current estimated 200-500 fighters represent 75%+ reduction from Jundallah peak (1,000-2,000). Group lacks capacity for major asymmetric operations or geographic expansion.
