    "one_line": "Severely degraded ISIS-Sinai with unknown fighters, declined since 2022 through military crackdowns and amnesty, no claimed attacks since February 2023.",
    "overview": "Islamic State–Sinai Province (ISIS-Sinai), formerly Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (ABM), is a significantly degraded ISIS affiliate based in northern Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Originally founded as al-Qaeda-aligned ABM in 2011 during post-Mubarak Egyptian uprising, the group pledged allegiance to ISIS in November 2014, forming ISIS-Sinai (designated Wilayat Sinai/Sinai Province). During peak operational period (2014-2021), ISIS-Sinai conducted 500+ attacks killing thousands, notably: (1) October 31, 2015 Metrojet bombing (224 killed—deadliest terrorist attack on civilians globally that year), and (2) November 24, 2017 al-Rawda Sufi mosque massacre (305-311 killed—deadliest terrorist attack in Egyptian history). Under leadership of Muhammad Ali al-Isawi (2016-2018 until death), the group waged sophisticated insurgency against Egyptian military with IEDs, suicide bombings, and small-arms assaults. Following intensive Egyptian counter-terrorism operations (2016-2022) and amnesty programs offering surrendered militants rehabilitation, ISIS-Sinai has been severely degraded. As of 2025, the group exists in significantly weakened state: no claimed attacks since February 2023, membership size unknown but substantially reduced, and organizational coherence fragmented. Regional terrorism threat substantially reduced compared to 2015-2017 peak, though localized residual threat remains.",

Initially al-Qaeda-aligned, the group focused on asymmetric warfare against Egyptian military and attacks on Israeli targets across Sinai-Gaza-Israel borders. The group radicalized following President Mohamed Morsi's removal from office (July 2013), escalating attacks in response to government crackdowns on Islamists.",

No claimed attacks since February 2023 indicates organizational dormancy. While membership size unknown, estimates suggest minimal remaining fighters (50-200 estimated).
