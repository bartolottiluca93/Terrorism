    "one_line": "Severely degraded ISIS-affiliated network in Bangladesh with several dozen fighters, notable for Holey Artisan Bakery attack, currently resurgent through diaspora networks and emerging Malaysia-based cells.",
    "overview": "ISIS's network in Bangladesh is a severely degraded terrorist affiliate based primarily on ISIS-aligned factions of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). Emerging from non-violent religious organizations around 2015, the network transitioned to armed insurgency in 2015, launching its first attack September 28, 2015 (Italian NGO worker murdered). The network achieved international infamy through the July 1, 2016 Holey Artisan Bakery siege in Dhaka that killed 22 people (primarily Italian and Japanese), coordinated by Canadian citizen Tamim Chowdhury. Following intensive crackdowns (2016-2021) that killed ~80 suspected militants and arrested 300+, the network was severely degraded to 'several dozen' active operatives. As of 2025, ISIS-Bangladesh operates as a fragmented cell-based network with limited operational capability within Bangladesh, but demonstrates resilience through transnational migration, diaspora networks, and 2025 resurgence evidence: Malaysia arrested 100-150 ISIS-linked Bangladeshi migrant workers (July 2025), and intelligence indicates JMB resurgence in Indian West Bengal border regions exploiting political instability. The network remains designated but poses reduced domestic threat compared to peak 2015-2017 period.",

The network appears to have formed from: (1) JMB members inspired by ISIS's 2014 caliphate declaration and Syria/Iraq foreign fighter success; (2) young, educated, middle-class Bangladeshis who traveled to Syria to fight for IS and returned radicalized; (3) coordination facilitated by Canadian citizen Tamim Chowdhury who returned from Syria with operational experience. The network transitioned from religious organization to armed cell network between 2015-2016.",
