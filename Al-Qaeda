For example, Al-Shabaab carries out near-weekly bombings and raids in Somalia, and Sahelian affiliates strike military and civilian targets in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger frequently. Attacks often surge during spring and summer \\\"fighting seasons\\\" in conflict zones. Globally, Al-Qaeda has encouraged lone-wolf attacks, leading to sporadic incidents inspired by its ideology. Overall, the pattern is decentralized: sustained low- to mid-intensity violence by affiliates, with the central leadership providing ideological direction and occasionally attempting spectacular international plots through its branches."

It lacks state-level weaponry (no precision guided missiles, tanks, or air power) and is vulnerable to surveillance and drone strikes when it uses electronic communications. Its members often have to limit communications and movement to avoid detection, which hinders large-scale coordination. The group’s financial transactions are constrained to cash and hawala networks to avoid the formal banking system, limiting large-scale funding flows. Additionally, Al-Qaeda has struggled to develop a sophisticated cyber capability and remains behind newer groups (like ISIS) in exploiting social media technology for recruitment."

YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter ban official Al-Qaeda accounts and take down videos of its leaders.

These pressures have forced Al-Qaeda to rely on the Dark Web, closed forums, or constantly shifting Telegram channels. The increased surveillance and quick removal of extremist content have limited Al-Qaeda’s open propaganda reach, although dedicated followers still circulate materials in less-regulated corners of the internet."

The group’s mass-casualty attacks deliberately target civilians or indiscriminately kill them, violating the right to life on a huge scale.

Al-Qaeda affiliates often impose harsh interpretations of sharia in areas they control, leading to abuses such as public executions, floggings, and the oppression of women and minorities. They also coerce local populations through intimidation and 'taxation' to support their cause, which infringes on personal freedoms and livelihoods. Moreover, by provoking heavy-handed counterterrorism operations, Al-Qaeda indirectly has contributed to environments where human rights are at risk (e.g., prolonged detentions, drone strikes causing collateral damage).
