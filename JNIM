    "one_line": "Al-Qaeda's most powerful affiliate, formed March 2017 from merger of 4 groups, now 4,000-6,000 fighters, deadliest jihadist globally in 2025 with 280+ attacks in H1 (1,000+ killed), controls $100M+ war economy (gold mining, ransoming, livestock theft), expanding into Nigeria/Benin, blockading Mali capital Bamako.",
    "overview": "Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM, 'Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims') is al-Qaeda's most operationally lethal and strategically important affiliate globally as of November 2025. Formed March 2, 2017 through formal merger of four Mali-based Salafi-jihadist groups—Ansar Dine, Katibat Macina (Macina Liberation Front/MLF), al-Mourabitoun, and AQIM's Sahara Emirate—JNIM unified under Iyad ag Ghali (Ansar Dine founder) as emir and Amadou Kouffa (MLF founder, Fulani ethnic leader) as deputy. Operating from Mali's strategic Timbuktu Emirate across Burkina Faso, Niger, and now Nigeria/Benin, JNIM commands 4,000-6,000 fighters and controls territory across 11 of Burkina Faso's regions plus major areas of Mali and Niger. In H1 2025, JNIM surpassed Boko Haram as Africa's deadliest jihadist organization, conducting 280+ attacks in Burkina Faso alone (~1,000 total Sahel casualties April-November 2025), with 800+ deaths in Burkina Faso, 117 in Mali, 74 in Benin, and recent November 11, 2025 expansion into Nigeria (Kwara State). JNIM operates a sophisticated $100M+ annual 'war economy' through artisanal gold mining ($34M+ annually from controlled sites exporting to UAE/Turkey/Switzerland), kidnapping-for-ransom ($40M+ per major incident), livestock theft (~$1M annually), drug trafficking coordination, arms smuggling taxation, and territorial control/governance. The group recently blockaded Mali's capital Bamako (July-November 2025), attacking fuel trucks and asserting de facto control over major transit corridors. Notably, JNIM is publicly distancing from al-Qaeda (June 2025 shift documented), omitting al-Qaeda references in communications and signaling potential HTS (Syria)-style rebranding to facilitate alliances with non-Islamic groups (Azawad Liberation Front/FLA). Leadership remains concentrated: Iyad ag Ghali (Tuareg ethnic leader, former diplomat) and Amadou Kouffa (Fulani ethnic leader, popular theologian) balance ethnic representation. As of November 2025, JNIM represents the primary threat to West African stability, controls more territory than most ISIS affiliates, and maintains direct al-Qaeda central coordination via Ayman al-Zawahiri.",

    "origin_context": "JNIM emerged from coordinated al-Qaeda strategy initiated 2012-2017 to consolidate Sahel jihadist groups under unified command. AQIM deliberately created Ansar Dine (2011) as 'cover' brand to mask AQIM's direct operation in Mali, appointing Iyad ag Ghali as frontman to appeal to Tuareg ethnic grievances. Following French military intervention (2012-2013) and territorial losses, al-Qaeda orchestrated progressive coalition-building: By 2015, Ansar Dine, al-Mourabitoun, MLF, and AQIM Sahara branch began informal coordination. The March 2, 2017 formal merger represented pinnacle of this strategy, consolidating estimated 3,000-4,000 fighters into unified command structure with direct al-Qaeda bay'ah (pledge of allegiance).",
